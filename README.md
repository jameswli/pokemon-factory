**Follow the symlink _source_ to view the code.**    
You may also import the directory eclipse_fies/ into Eclipse to view the project. Actual codes are located under eclipse_files/src/

**Servers and clients are already properly implemented.**    
To run our application, start a server first, and then run either of our managers:    
* LaneManager
* KitRobotManager
* PartsRobotManager
